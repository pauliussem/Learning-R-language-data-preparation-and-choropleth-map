# Learning R language

Since I wanted to expand Power BI capabilities and challenge myself, created few R projects.
The main target was to learn how to import files and work with them, how to sort data and how to use shape files and make choropleth maps with it.

3 different projects were made based on dashboards which Iâ€™ve made before with Power BI.

### Declared crops by groups in 2024.

### Change in winter cereals declared area in 2024 compared to 2023.

### Provided applications by declared area intervals.
